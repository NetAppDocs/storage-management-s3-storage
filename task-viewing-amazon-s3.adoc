After you install a Console agent in AWS, NetApp Console can automatically discover information about the Amazon S3 buckets that reside in the AWS account where the Console agent is installed. An Amazon S3 system is added to the Systems page so you can view this information.

You can see details about your S3 buckets, including the region, access policy, account, total and used capacity, and more. These buckets can be used as destinations for NetApp backup and recovery, NetApp tiering, or NetApp copy and sync operations. Additionally, you can use NetApp Data Classification to scan these buckets.
